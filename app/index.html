    Sometimes you have to give into cliche. This was the best night of our lives
    and you all made it what it was. From the faces appearing that we
    hadn&rsquo;t seen in years, to the ones that had to send their wishes from
    afar, we spent the whole night overjoyed and thrilled to celebrate with each
    of you. <strong>Thank you to everyone for being a part of the best thing
      we&rsquo;ve ever done.</strong>

    Our photographer has a sneak peak of a few early photos available. If you
    ask us, they&rsquo;re pretty amazing. We&rsquo;ll let you know when
    there&rsquo;s more, but for now check out her

    We want to specifically and publicly thank some of our closest friends that
    worked (way more than we meant them to) like mad to make it such a fun and
    memorable night.

  <h2>The Awkwardly True Story</h2>
  <p>
    Over six years ago, Aki &amp; Mark were leading very different lives on very
    different paths. By chance, they both found themselves working the same position
    within Apple&hellip; and their first encounter involved Aki managing to screw
    Mark&rsquo;s inventory up from 95 miles away. After a phone call to clear it
    all up, Mark told his coworker &ldquo;She sounds cute&rdquo;.
  </p>

  <p>
    After meeting a few times, Aki asked Mark if he wanted to go on an adventure.
    Mark asked Aki if she wanted to be his girlfriend. Only one said yes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mark was patient though. Eventually she told him, in a fit of <del>defeat</del>
    frustration, &ldquo;I want you to be my !@#$%^ boyfriend!&rdquo; and then they
    left for Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest, as they say, is history, and now, six years later, we&rsquo;re finally
    getting married!
