  <h2>The Awkwardly True Story</h2>
  <p>
    Over six years ago, Aki &amp; Mark were leading very different lives on very
    different paths. By chance, they both found themselves working the same position
    within Apple&hellip; and their first encounter involved Aki managing to screw
    Mark&rsquo;s inventory up from 95 miles away. After a phone call to clear it
    all up, Mark told his coworker &ldquo;She sounds cute&rdquo;.
  </p>

  <p>
    After meeting a few times, Aki asked Mark if he wanted to go on an adventure.
    Mark asked Aki if she wanted to be his girlfriend. Only one said yes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mark was patient though. Eventually she told him, in a fit of <del>defeat</del>
    frustration, &ldquo;I want you to be my !@#$%^ boyfriend!&rdquo; and then they
    left for Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest, as they say, is history, and now, six years later, we&rsquo;re finally
    getting married!
