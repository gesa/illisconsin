# Gifts

Since we&rsquo;ll be moving across the country soon, a traditional registry full
of things to pack and move is a little daunting. Instead, we&rsquo;ve put together
a list of some of the things that will help us set up our new home and quirky lives
in California. You can head over to our [Simple Registry](http://simpleregistry.com/markandaki)
to see the things that you can help with to send us on our way.

Most importantly, we&rsquo;d be thrilled to see you in Milwaukee to celebrate!
