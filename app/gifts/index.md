## Gifts

_Gifts are absolutely not required nor expected!_

If you’re feeling really generous and insist on a little something, then first off:
Thanks! That’s really sweet! But after the wedding this summer, we’ll be packing up
and heading west to warmer climates. That being so, instead of more items to manage,
maybe you’d consider contributing to our new wedded home in another way?
