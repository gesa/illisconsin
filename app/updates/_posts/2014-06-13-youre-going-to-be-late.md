So, there’s a [Summer Solstice festival](http://www.theeastside.org/categories/7-summer-soulstice/documents/12-the-summer-soulstice-music-festival)
every year in Milwaukee. A lovely time is had by all—drinks, music, dancing, the
whole nine. Like any good Wisconsin town getting its party on, several city
blocks will be shut down. Several city blocks very close to The Landmark.

### What does this mean for you?

Leave early. [Don’t drive yourself](https://uber.com/invite/pvx5v). Carpool.
[Take the bus](http://ridemcts.com/).


There are a bunch of you centralised downtown and by the airport, so if you’re
interested in being connected will fellow guests, let me know and I’ll try to
arrange something. Otherwise, don’t forget about Uber and Milwaukee’s great Park
& Ride buses!

Can’t wait to see you in a week!
