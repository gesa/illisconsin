Okay I don’t want anyone to get over-confident here, but Mark was able to find
some local parking options on the day of the wedding. The thing is, as we
mentioned in [the last blog post](http://illisconsin.com/updates/2014/06/13/youre-going-to-be-late/),
there is a [pretty big festival](http://www.theeastside.org/categories/7-summer-soulstice/documents/12-the-summer-soulstice-music-festival)
going on just a half block away from the venue on the day of the wedding, which
starts at 10am. The neighborhood is opening up a lot of public parking for the
day, but who knows how much of it will be available be the time we are ready to
say our vows. If you do plan on driving yourself, maybe think about coming early
to grab some parking and just generally enjoy the festival!

You can find more information about parking on [the east side](http://www.theeastside.org/categories/16-parking/documents/47-parking-on-the-east-side)’s
website, and we plan on opening doors to our private bar at the Landmark at
4:30pm. Open bar starts at 5pm sharp.
