Whoops, we had a small issue with the site. Some RSVPs before 4/8 might not have 
been saved when using certain browsers. Everything is fine now and after midday 
on 4/8 you can use the RSVP form as normal. 

If you RSVP’d before 4/8, and you **aren’t** with Gina, Stephanie, Mary, Daniel, 
Jen, Ashe or Mikaela, then we probably don’t have your response or contact info
Please feel free to RSVP again if you’re concerned. We’ll clear any doubles out.

Can’t wait to see you!
