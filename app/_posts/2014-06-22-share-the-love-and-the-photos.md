title: "Share the Love—and the Photos!"

We would love to see the photos and videos you took last night. I’m sure many
will make their way to facebook, twitter, instagram, or whichever other social
tools the kids are using these days. Tag ’em with #illisconsin, then, it would
mean the world to us if you sent on the links or files for us to put together,
either to be compiled and featured and here on this blog, or just to have for
our own memories. 

Take your pick and send any links or files to us...

- via email at [markandaki@gmail.com](mailto:markandaki@gmail.com) or 
[questions@illisconsin.com](questions@illisconsin.com)
- via our albums at [wedpics](https://www.wedpics.com/wedding/MjQyMzE2/album),
(right from your
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wedpics-wedding-photo-app/id549402355?mt=8)
or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dejami.WedPics)
phone, or via the [webapp](https://www.wedpics.com/wedding/MjQyMzE2/album)) with
wedding ID 'landmark'.
- or if your photos are too big for standard email, you can send them straight
to [our flickr account](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/makirolledaway/tags/wedding/)
at this email address:
[street63charge@photos.flickr.com](mailto:street63charge@photos.flickr.com) (any
message content—including your email signature—will show up in the description
