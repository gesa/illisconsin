Hi there friends, Aki here. Someone once asked me if I could write them a short
email detailing a few things to do in Milwaukee, as they knew they were spending
a weekend in town. I ended up saving the result and revising it over and over
again because as it turns out Milwaukee is AWESOME. So, if you’re getting in on
Thursday or Friday, or not leaving until Monday or Tuesday, here are a few
recommendations on things to do and see while you are in our fair city.

A couple additional notes though:
 
- Since I last edited this love letter, our friends Ryan and Becky have opened
this genius place called [Bounce Milwaukee](http://www.bouncemilwaukee.com/),
where you can drink alcohol AND play laser tag or bounce around in bounce
houses. It’s just the best.
- Probably best to just ignore the parts about lodging since that’s basically
all booked up.
- Since the love letter is timeless, it doesn’t include the
[Milwaukee Air & Water Show](http://www.milwaukeeairshow.com/) (a major culprit
in the lack of lodging, I might add) which is going on this weekend.
- As we mentioned in a previous blog post, The East Side is also celebrating its
annual [Summer Soulstice festival](www.theeastside.org/categories/7-summer-soulstice/documents/12-the-summer-soulstice-music-festival)
on Saturday from 10am until midnight.

Okay, now on to the letter.


If you’re looking for a place to stay, there is a very cool hotel just south of
downtown called the [Iron Horse](http://www.theironhorsehotel.com/). The rooms
are sweet, the bar is great, and the location is fabulous. It’s across the
street from a micro distillery
([Great Lakes Distillery](http://www.greatlakesdistillery.com/)) and the best
dirty (in the complementary sense), cheap mexican place in the city,
[Conejitos Place](http://conejitos-place.com/).

Another great lodging option is
[County Clare](http://www.countyclare-inn.com/Guesthouse.html), which has a
great Irish restaurant attached that features a full vegetarian and vegan menu.
Not something you encounter frequently with Irish food! County Clare is just
north of downtown, on the lower east side. It’s a little more affordable than
Iron Horse, but a bit simpler as well.

My all-time favorite brewery tour ever (and I’ve been to a *ton*) is 
[Lakefront Brewery](http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com/tour). If you’re going to go 
though, get tickets asap. They sell out fast. When you go to Lakefront, aside 
from getting a ton of free beer and a free pint glass, you get a coupon for a 
free beer at one of a long list of restaurants, which is wise, because you’ll 
want dinner. I’m not sure what kind of dinner you’re going for, but if you want 
to use your coupon (and you probably will) I’d go to 
[Balzac](http://balzacwinebar.com/) for small plate dining (it’s a wine bar, but 
has great beers too) or [Wicked Hop](http://www.thewickedhop.com/) for 
sandwiches, american dinners, and a little more bustling of an atmosphere. The 
list of participating has grown and changed recently, so those places may not 
be on it. 

Another place I *love* to bring people from out of town to for a cocktail or two
(but not dinner usually, their food is kind of meh) is the incredible 
([and](http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/wisconsin-hog-heaven-865615.html)
[rather](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/02/coolhunting-weird-wisconsin-episode-4_n_1032721.html?ref=travel&ncid=edlinkusaolp00000008)
[famous](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/st_hiddenplaces/?pid=4536&viewall=true))
[Safe House](http://www.safe-house.com/). There is a password required to get 
in, but don’t worry if you don’t know it. Control will find a way to… deal with
you. Do yourself a favor and don’t try to google the password if you go—it’s 
more fun for everyone if you don’t cheat. If you have a vegetarian in your party
(but meat-eaters can find great food too) I think my favorite restaurant in the
city is a place called [Beans & Barley](http://www.beansandbarley.com/), which 
is both a small grocery store and a full restaurant. I love the tofu burger and 
the walnut burger, my partner stresses that the sweet potato & bean burrito
cannot be beat. 

If you like any combination of architecture, art, and culture, try to find some 
time to check out the [Milwaukee Art Museum](http://mam.org/). It’s designed by 
Santiago Calatrava (of [Chicago Spire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Spire)
fame, even though MAM came first) and watching the building "open" (or close)
is a sight to behold. Oh also there’s some pretty cool art. We also have these 
[geodesic domes](http://county.milwaukee.gov/MitchellParkConserva10116.htm), 
which, let’s be honest, are cooler for being geodesic domes than they are for 
what’s inside. Don’t get me wrong, the various environments and plants are
great, just not what I would probably prioritize in a new city. Luckily, though,
Those are basically across the street from
[Potawatomi Bingo & Casino](http://www.paysbig.com/), which is open 24 hours,
and still allows smoking, if that’s your thing. I love the place and think it’s
a trip. 

If you realize at some point that you just want to relax and drink at a bar that
the locals drink at, [hit me up on twitter](https://twitter.com/gesa). I can
often be found at [Lee’s Luxury Lounge](http://www.avclub.com/milwaukee/venues/lees-luxury-lounge,36718/)
on Friday & Saturday nights. 

I hope this is helpful, if you have any Milwaukee-specific questions,
let me know! As you may be able to tell… I love my city. Have a fun trip!
