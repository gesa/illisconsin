<h1>Questions</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>What’s the dress code?</dt>
  <dd>
    Chicken suits. Ok, not really. But if you show up in a chicken suit, we’ll
    give you $5. Fancy not required but we’ll be dressed to the nines and a bit
    offbeat! Funky, dapper, stunning, relaxed. Whatever makes you want to
    celebrate, dance and be merry.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can we bring the kids?</dt>
  <dd>
    We’re not too up on kids limits, so that’s up to you. The bar we’ll be
    celebrating at has bowling lanes and a small arcade if they’re old enough
    for that kind of thing. For those of you with more recent offspring, let us
    know if there’s anything we can arrange to make things easier.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can I bring a date?</dt>

  <dd></dd>

  </dd>
  <dt>What should/could I do between the ceremony and the reception?</dt>
  <dd>
    You should walk from the theater to the bar 30 feet away and start partying!
  </dd>
  <dt>Will food be served?</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>What kind of food will be served?</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>What if I have a dietary restriction?</dt>
  <dd>Your RSVP should have had options to include any dietary restrictions. If
    you RSVP’d but forgot something, please email us at questions@adofhaigd.com
  </dd>
  <dt>Will there be dancing?</dt>
  <dd>There better be.</dd>
  <dt>Will there be any activities happening that I need to know about?</dt>
  <dd>The bar is more than a bar, it includes pool tables, a bowling lane and a
    small arcade. But there won’t be anything special that requires scuba gear
    or anything like that.
  </dd>
  <dt>What time will the reception end?</dt>
  <dd>Open bar turns into a pumpkin at 11:00pm, but bar time in Milwaukee is at
    2:00am, so you’ll be able to party until your out of money.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can I take pictures?</dt>
  <dd>Of course. But promise to upload/send them to us! There will be a
    professional photographer on hand and we’ll provide access to those photos.
    Don’t feel you need to record the event - you’ll be free to sit back and
    enjoy!
  </dd>
  <dt>Is there a gifts registry?</dt>
  <dd>Check out the <a href="/gifts/">Gifts</a> page.</dd>
  <dt>What if I want to donate my services to the cause instead of give a
    gift?
  </dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Is there transportation being provided between reception and hotels?</dt>
  <dd>Unfortunately not. Cabs are plentiful and there will likely be other
    guests heading your way if you want to share rides.
  </dd>
  <dt>Will last names be changing after the wedding?</dt>
  <dd>That’s a perfectly reasonable question that we need to remember to delete
    until we have an answer.
  </dd>
  <dt>I have a question not answered here; how do I contact you?</dt>
  <dd>If you could email us at questions@alkjgalkdhg.com that would help us keep
    things organized and hopefully we’ll be able to get back to you quickly. On
    the day of…
