<h1>Questions</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>What&rsquo;s the dress code?</dt>
  <dd>
    Chicken suits. Ok, not really. But if you show up in a chicken suit, we&rsquo;ll
    give you $5. Fancy not required, but we&rsquo;ll be dressed to the nines and
    a bit offbeat. Funky, dapper, stunning, relaxed. Whatever makes you want to
    celebrate, dance and be merry. (Anything from blue jeans to that ball gown you
    bought for the inauguration never to wear again is &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.)
  </dd>

  <dt>Can we bring the kids?</dt>
  <dd>
    Bars in Milwaukee allow minors as long as they&rsquo;re supervised&hellip; AND
    the bar we&rsquo;ll be celebrating at has bowling lanes as well as a small arcade
    if they&rsquo;re old enough for that kind of thing. For those of you with more
    recent offspring, let us know if there&rsquo;s anything we can arrange to make
    things easier.
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I bring a date?</dt>
  <dd>
    We included the famed &ldquo;+1&rdquo; with all guests over 18. 
  </dd>

  <dt>When is the RSVP deadline?</dt>
  <dd>
    That&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable question. 
  </dd>

  <dt>Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?</dt>
  <dd>
    We&rsquo;re super sorry, but with the age of the Landmark and its basement
    location, the only way to the venue is down a full flight of stairs. Please
    let us know if there&rsquo;s anything we can do or talk to the venue about if
    this is an issue.
  </dd>

  <dt>What should/could I do between the ceremony and the reception?</dt>
  <dd>
    You should turn from the two of us to the bar and order a drink!
  </dd>

  <dt>Will food be served?</dt>
  <dd>
    Sure will. Should be around 7 p.m.
  </dd>

  <dt>What kind of food will be served?</dt>
  <dd>
    A whole smattering of pizza and goodies from <a href="http://theclassicslice.com">Classic Slice</a>,
    our favorite pizza joint. There will be veggie pizza, vegan pizza, meat pizza,
    strange pizza, loud pizza and pizza with green eggs and ham. 
  </dd>

  <dt>What if I have a dietary restriction?</dt>
  <dd>Your RSVP should have had options to include any dietary restrictions. If
    you RSVP&rsquo;d but forgot something, please email us at <a href="mailto:questions@illisconsin.com">questions@illisconsin.com</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Will there be dancing?</dt>
  <dd>There better be.</dd>

  <dt>Will there be any activities happening that I need to know about?</dt>
  <dd>
    The bar is more than a bar, it includes pool tables, a bowling lane and a small
    arcade. But there won&rsquo;t be anything special that requires scuba gear or
    anything like that.
  </dd>

  <dt>What time will the reception end?</dt>
  <dd>Open bar turns into a pumpkin at 11:00 p.m., but bar time in Milwaukee is at
    2:00 a.m., so you&rsquo;ll be able to party until you&rsquo;re out of money.
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I take pictures?</dt>
  <dd>
    Of course&mdash;as long as you plan to share them with us! Any photos you take
    with your digital camera or smartphone, can be added to our <a href="https://www.wedpics.com/wedding/MjQyMzE2/album">WedPics Album</a>
    by installing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wedpics-wedding-photo-app/id549402355?mt=8">iOS</a>
    or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dejami.WedPics">Android</a>
    app and using Wedding ID &ldquo;landmark&rdquo;. All that said, don&rsquo;t
    feel you need to record the event. There will be a professional photographer
    on hand whose photos we&rsquo;ll share with our guests, so you&rsquo;ll be free
    to sit back and enjoy!
  </dd>

  <dt>Is there a gifts registry?</dt>
  <dd>Check out the <a href="/gifts/">Gifts</a> page.</dd>

  <dt>
    What if I want to donate my services to the cause instead of give a gift?
  </dt>
  <dd>
  	That is super awesome! But we don&rsquo;t have a ton to do as this is a pretty
    chill wedding. If you really want to help set up, or get leftovers back to our
    place, or be otherwise sober and responsible, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:questions@illisconsin.com">questions@illisconsin.com</a>
    and we&rsquo;ll see what there is for you.
  </dd>

  <dt>Is there transportation being provided between reception and hotels?</dt>
  <dd>
    Unfortunately not. Cabs are plentiful and there will likely be other guests
    heading your way if you want to share rides.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Will last names be changing after the wedding?</dt>
  <dd>
    That&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable question that we need to remember to delete
    until we have an answer.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>I have a question not answered here; how do I contact you?</dt>
  <dd>
    If you could email us at <a href="mailto:questions@illisconsin.com">questions@illisconsin.com</a>
    that would help us keep things organized and hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to
    get back to you quickly. On the day of, we&rsquo;ll have a point person for
    this sort of thing and that person&rsquo;s contact info will hopefully make
    its way here and to the <a href="/updates/">Updates</a> page.
