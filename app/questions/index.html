<h1>Questions</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>What’s the dress code?</dt>
  <dd>
    Chicken suits. Ok, not really. But if you show up in a chicken suit, we’ll
    give you $5. Fancy not required but we’ll be dressed to the nines and a bit
    offbeat! Funky, dapper, stunning, relaxed. Whatever makes you want to
    celebrate, dance and be merry.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can we bring the kids?</dt>
  <dd>
    Bars in Milwaukee allow minors so long as they're supervised. AND the bar we’ll be 
    celebrating at has bowling lanes and a small arcade if they’re old enough
    for that kind of thing. For those of you with more recent offspring, let us
    know if there’s anything we can arrange to make things easier.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can I bring a date?</dt>
  <dd>
    We included the famed “+1” with all guests over 18. 
  </dd>
  <dt>When is the RSVP deadline</dt>
  <dd>
    That's a perfectly reasonable question. 
  </dd>
  <dt>Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?</dt>
  <dd>
We're super sorry, but with the age of the Landmark and it's basement location, the only way to the venue is down a full flight of stairs. Please let us know if there's anything we can do or talk to the venue about if this is an issue.
  </dd>
  <dt>What should/could I do between the ceremony and the reception?</dt>
  <dd>
    You should turn from the two of us to the bar and order a drink!
  </dd>
  <dt>Will food be served?</dt>
  <dd>
    Sure will. Should be around 7PM.
  </dd>
  <dt>What kind of food will be served?</dt>
  <dd>
    A whole smattering of pizza and goodies from <a href="http://theclassicslice.com">Classic Slice</a>, our favorite pizza joint. There will be veggie pizza, vegan pizza, meat pizza, strange pizza, loud pizza and pizza with green eggs and ham. 
  </dd>
  <dt>What if I have a dietary restriction?</dt>
  <dd>Your RSVP should have had options to include any dietary restrictions. If
    you RSVP’d but forgot something, please email us at questions@illisconsin.com
  </dd>
  <dt>Will there be dancing?</dt>
  <dd>There better be.</dd>
  <dt>Will there be any activities happening that I need to know about?</dt>
  <dd>The bar is more than a bar, it includes pool tables, a bowling lane and a
    small arcade. But there won’t be anything special that requires scuba gear
    or anything like that.
  </dd>
  <dt>What time will the reception end?</dt>
  <dd>Open bar turns into a pumpkin at 11:00pm, but bar time in Milwaukee is at
    2:00am, so you’ll be able to party until your out of money.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can I take pictures?</dt>
  <dd>Of course. But promise to upload/send them to us! There will be a
    professional photographer on hand and we’ll provide access to those photos.
    Don’t feel you need to record the event - you’ll be free to sit back and
    enjoy!
  </dd>
  <dt>Is there a gifts registry?</dt>
  <dd>Check out the <a href="/gifts/">Gifts</a> page.</dd>
  <dt>What if I want to donate my services to the cause instead of give a
    gift?
  </dt>
  <dd>
  	That is super awesome! But we don't have a ton to do as this is a pretty chill wedding. 
  	If you really want to help set up, or get leftovers back to our place, or be otherwise sober
    and responsible. Drop us a line at questions@illisconsin.com and we'll see what there is for you.
  </dd>
  <dt>Is there transportation being provided between reception and hotels?</dt>
  <dd>Unfortunately not. Cabs are plentiful and there will likely be other
    guests heading your way if you want to share rides.
  </dd>
  <dt>Will last names be changing after the wedding?</dt>
  <dd>That’s a perfectly reasonable question that we need to remember to delete
    until we have an answer.
  </dd>
  <dt>I have a question not answered here; how do I contact you?</dt>
  <dd>If you could email us at questions@illisconsin.com that would help us keep
    things organized and hopefully we’ll be able to get back to you quickly. On
    the day of, we'll have a point person for this sort of thing and that person's contact info
    will hopefully make its way here and to the <a href="/updates/">Updates</a> page.
