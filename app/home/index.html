    Over six years ago, Aki &amp; Mark were leading very different lives on very different
    paths. By chance, they both found themselves working the same position within Apple&hellip;
    and their first encounter involved Aki managing to screw Mark&rsquo;s inventory
    up from 95 miles away. After a phone call to clear it all up, Mark told his coworker
    &ldquo;She sounds cute&rdquo;.

    Some months later, they met face-to-face at an internal conference in Minneapolis,
    and started to correspond regularly. Aki asked Mark if he wanted to go on an
    adventure. Mark asked Aki if she wanted to be his girlfriend. Only one said yes.

    Mark was patient though, and Aki was&hellip; Aki.

    Presumably, if you&rsquo;re here then you&rsquo;re invited. If not, then this is just
    awkward. But for the people that ARE invited, you should be able to get all
    the info you need about the weird, awesome, fun, nerdy, and grossly sweet
    wedding that you&rsquo;re going to attend.
