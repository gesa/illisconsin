      There&rsquo;s incredibly limited street meter parking outside the theater
      and throughout the neighborhood, but it&rsquo;s hard to come by, so plan to
      circle for a while if that&rsquo;s your thing. There are a very few paid lots
      nearby, but please call them ahead as restrictions on time and payment can
      be confusing.

      If you're staying in town, a cab may be a better bet. You can get all the
      way across town for about $20. Cabs CANNOT be hailed in Milwaukee. Call American
      United at (414) 220-5000 or Milwaukee Cab Co-op at (414) 271-1800 with your
      pick up time, location and payment method.
