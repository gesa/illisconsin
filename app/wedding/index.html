<h2>Getting there</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Driving yourself? Good luck with parking. There&rsquo;s incredibly
      limited street meter parking outside the theater and throughout the
      neighborhood, but it&rsquo;s hard to come by, so plan to circle for a
      while if
      that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
