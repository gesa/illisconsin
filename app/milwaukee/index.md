# Coming to Milwaukee

Are you traveling to Milwaukee for little ol’ us? Awesome! We’re really flattered and wanted give some tips to make the trip as easy as possible.

---

### Planes

Milwaukee’s General Mitchell Airport is really convenient. It’s smallish (though served by Southwest!) and only a few minutes from the action via surface streets. Flying in to Chicago is doable with a car rental, but without is a big pain in the CTA-to-Amtrak-to-MCTS-butt.

---

### Trains/Public Transit

Amtrak runs from Chicago’s Union Station to Milwaukee for around $22 and has stops both at the Milwaukee Airport and downtown, so it should be easy to get to a hotel. The downside is that Milwaukee doesn’t have light rail and the buses are only kind of convenient. You can check routes and time tables at rideMCTS.com. Otherwise, if you'll just be in for a night or two from Illinois, Amtrak and cabs are a doable, if slightly pricey, option.

---

### Automobiles

Milwaukee is far less congested than Chicago and parking is rarely hard. (Except near the wedding venue. Sorry. The <a href="/wedding/">Wedding Page</a> has more details on that.) That said, cabs CANNOT be hailed on the street and must be called. If you’re drinking, here’s a couple handy numbers to store in your cellphone:
American United Taxi: 414-220-5000
Yellow Cab Co-Op: 414-271-1800

### Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn

Because so many people will have different preferences, we haven’t had any rooms set aside. Milwaukee isn’t a big city and it’s pretty quick to get around. <strong>Please note, our wedding will be the same weekend as the Milwaukee Air and Water Show, so last minute booksin may be difficult.</strong> Also, some hotels have a three night minimum because of the show. Here’s a range of places around town that may fit your tastes, but anything Downtown, near the airport or east of the river on the East Side would be a good choice.
