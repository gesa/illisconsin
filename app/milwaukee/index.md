## Coming to Milwaukee

Are you traveling to Milwaukee for little ol’ us? Awesome! We’re really flattered and wanted to see if we could gives some tips to make the trip as easy as possible.

### Planes

Milwaukee’s General Mitchell Airport is really convenient. It’s smallish (thought served by Southwest!) and only a few minutes from the action via surface streets. Flying in to Chicago is doable with a car rental, but without is a big pain in the CTA-to-Amtrak-to-MCTS-butt.

### Trains/Public Transit

Amtrak runs from Chicago’s Union Station to Milwaukee for around $22 and has stops both at the Milwaukee Airport and downtown, so it should be easy to get to a hotel. The downside is that Milwaukee doesn’t have light rail and the buses are only kind of convenient. You can check routes and time tables at rideMCTS.com.

### Automobiles

Milwaukee is far less congested than Chicago and parking is rarely hard. That said, cabs CANNOT be haled on the street and must be called. If you’re drinking, here’s a couple handy numbers to store in your cellphone:
American United Taxi: 414-220-5000
Yellow Cab Co-Op: 414-271-1800
